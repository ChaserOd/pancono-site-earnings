<h2>✨ Getting Started:</h2>


<h1>🚀 Testnet Mining</h1>
<p>Download the app and start mining on the Testnet.  
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the “Start Mine” tab to begin mining Testnet Panno coins. You will see your mining session active and blocks being hashed.  
For every block you mine, you will receive <strong>30 PANNO</strong>. Keep mining as many blocks as you can. Once you have mined between 20 to 100 blocks, stop the mining process.</p>

<p>Next, go to the Pancono folder and locate the <strong>‘wallet_0.dat’</strong> file. This file contains the Testnet coins you mined. Move the <strong>wallet_0.dat</strong> file from the Pancono folder to your desktop, then submit it through the Google Form provided below.</p>

<p>Repeat this mining and submission process regularly.  
Since this is a Testnet version, mining does not require heavy computational power and each block can be mined in approximately <strong>3 to 5 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>Mining is the process where computers solve mathematical puzzles to verify transactions, mine Panno coins, and add new blocks to the blockchain. The miner who solves the puzzle first receives newly minted PANNO (and transaction fees if applicable), making them the “winner” of that round.</p>

---

<h1>🚀 Mainnet Mining</h1>
<p>Download the app and start mining on the Mainnet.  
Mainnet mining is the <strong>real</strong> mining process where you earn actual Panno coins.</p>

<p>Just like the Testnet, click the “Start Mine” tab to begin mining. You may stop mining anytime you wish.  
However, <strong>do NOT submit your Mainnet ‘wallet_0.dat’ file</strong> through the Google Form because it contains your real mined coins.</p>

<p>Since Mainnet mining is real computational work, it may require significantly more processing power, and mining each block can be medium to hard depending on your system.</p>

<p>The mining process is identical: computers compete to solve mathematical puzzles, verify transactions, and earn newly created PANNO. The miner who solves the puzzle first receives the reward.</p>

---

<h1>🚀 Become a Pancono Partner</h1>


<p>Become a Pancono Partner and receive your own Pancono Bot to promote the project and earn unlimited rewards in BTC, ETH, TON, and more.</p>

<p>Once you receive your bot, your task is simple → refer as many friends as possible using your referral link inside the bot. Those users will further refer others, helping your bot grow into thousands of users.</p>

<p>The more users your bot has, the higher your potential crypto earnings whenever users buy any product or service from the bot. More users = more earnings.</p>

Move that wallet_0.dat folder from the Pancono folder to desktop and submit it from below google form. Repeat the same mining and submiting process on regular basis. Note that since it a testnet app therefore mining doesnt take much computational power and is easy to mine every block in 3 to 5 min time.</p>
