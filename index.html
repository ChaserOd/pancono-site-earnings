<h1>🚀 Inviting friends & Testnet Mining.</h1>

    <strong>“Step 1: Download:"</strong>Download the pancono testnet app from below link.</p>

    <strong>“Step 2: Inviting Friends:"</strong>Get Invite friends link from below telegram bot and invite one friend. Can check the total invited friends count at telegram bot.</p>
 
<strong>“Step 3: Mining:”</strong> Once you invited one friend, go to downloaded testnet app and click “Start Mine” tab to begin mining Testnet Panno coins. You will see your mining session active and blocks being hashed as shown at above image of app.  
For every block you mine, you will receive <strong>30 testnet PANNO coins</strong>. Remember that for every 5,000 testnet coins you earn you will earn 1 to 500 Mainnet coins as reward during mainnet launch and airdrop. Therefore Keep mining as many blocks as you can. Once you have mined between 20 to 100 blocks, stop the mining process.</p>
<p>Next, go to the Pancono folder somewhere at your desktop and locate the<strong>‘wallet_0.dat’</strong> file. This file contains the Testnet coins you mined. Move that file from the Pancono folder to your desktop, then submit it through the  <strong>'Google Form to Submit Testnet Files'</strong> provided below. At form find <strong>'Add File'</strong> and submit it from there. Also tick mark done invited one friend.</p>
        
<p><strong>Step 4: Repeat the Above Steps:</strong> Invite at least one friend before mining, then follow the steps again. Repeat this daily to maximize your earning testnet coins.</p>
    

    <h2>✨ Rewards for Mainnet Airdrop</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1️⃣ Mine 5,000 testnet coins and you earn you will earn 1 to 500 Mainnet coins.</li>
      <li>2️⃣Mine 100,000 testnet coins and you earn you will earn 5 to 1000 Mainnet coins.</li>
      <li>2️⃣Mine 1,000,000 testnet coins and you earn you will earn 10 to 10000 Mainnet coins.</li>
      <li>2️⃣Mine 10,000,000 testnet coins and you earn you will earn 20 to 100,000 Mainnet coins.</li>
    </ul>


<p>The launch of the mainnet, final airdrop, rewards distribution, and tokenomics will be announced on our official Twitter, Telegram, and other social media accounts.</p>

   <h2>✨Lower Mining Dificulty</h2> 
<p>Since this is a Testnet version, mining does not require heavy computational power and each block can be mined in approximately <strong>3 to 5 minutes</strong>.Watch youtube video availabe at this app on how to mine.</p>

<p>Mining is the process where computers solve mathematical puzzles to verify transactions, mine Panno coins, and add new blocks to the blockchain. The miner who solves the puzzle first receives newly minted PANNO (and transaction fees if applicable), making them the “winner” of that round.</p>

<h1>🚀 Mainnet Mining</h1>
<p>Mainnet download app at above link will be available during the mainnet launch and final airdrop distribution date. Once available, download the app and start mining on the Mainnet. Mainnet mining is the <strong>real</strong> mining process where you will earn actual Panno coins.</p>


<p>Just like the Testnet, click the “Start Mine” tab to begin mining. You may stop mining anytime you wish.  
However, <strong>do NOT submit your Mainnet ‘wallet_0.dat’ file</strong> through the Google Form because it contains your real mined coins.</p>

<p>Since Mainnet mining is real computational work, it may require significantly more processing power, and mining each block can be medium to hard depending on your system.</p>

<p>The mining process is identical: computers compete to solve mathematical puzzles, verify transactions and mine new PANNO coins. The miner who solves the puzzle first receives the reward.</p>
    <p>Note that the mainnet will start very soon after the tesnet is over</p>
